# CS-11-Cpp

This is a repository containing the projects that I have completed in the C++
track of CS 11. The course description is as follows:

"A self-paced lab that provides students with extra practice and supervision
in transferring their programming skills to a particular programming language;
the course can be used for any language of the studentâ€™s choosing, subject to
approval by the instructor. A series of exercises guide the student through
the pragmatic use of the chosen language, building his or her familiarity,
experience, and style."


Contents of the labs:
    Lab 1-4: Unit Converters that progressively build on elements of the
             previous labs.\n
    Lab 5: A rational number class with arithmetic and other operations.\n
    Lab 6-7: A 2D matrix class with arithmetic and other operations.\n
