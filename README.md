# CS-11-Cpp

This is a repository containing the projects that I have completed in the C++ track of CS 11. The course description is 
as follows:

"A self-paced lab that provides students with extra practice and supervision in transferring their programming skills 
to a particular programming language; the course can be used for any language of the studentâ€™s choosing, subject to 
approval by the instructor. A series of exercises guide the student through the pragmatic use of the chosen language, 
building his or her familiarity, experience, and style."
